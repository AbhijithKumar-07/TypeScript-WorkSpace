// let var_name: dataType_of_value = value
// Here we are providing 'dataType_of_value' -->> It is known as 'Annotation'
//Example 1
let n: number = 7;
// Here we are providing the dataType of variable n 
// -->> So, the 'dataType' of the variable we are providing is known as "Annotation"

// Example 2
let obj : {name: string; isStudent: boolean} = {
    name: "Abhijith",
    isStudent: true
}
// Here In the above example --> {name: string; isStudent: boolean} --> This is "Annotation"


// Now for providing "our OWN name" to the "Annotation" --> We use 'Type Aliasing'
